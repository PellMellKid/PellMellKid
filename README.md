### :wave: About me

Hi! I'm Holly and I live in Vermont, USA. I work at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) as the Club Operations Lead. I get to meet and work with amazing, inspiring technical teenagers every day, and I love it! I help new high school coding clubs get started around the world.

I've worked for more than 10 years in the banking industry, focused mainly in the customer service and operations spaces

A fun fact about me is that I grew up in a town where my graduating high school class was a total of 41 people!
